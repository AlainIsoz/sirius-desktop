h1. Bundle @org.eclipse.sirius.editor.sequence@

This bundle contains the VSM editor support for the sequence diagram descriptions. It is 100% generated by Acceleo  from the @model/sequence.genmodel@ file. Note that the @model/sequence.ecore@ file the genmodel refers to is a local copy of the file in @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.sequence/model/sequence.ecore@. The version in  @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.sequence@ is the authoritative one. The local copy in this bundle should be kept in sync when the main version changes, and the @genmodel@ refreshed.
