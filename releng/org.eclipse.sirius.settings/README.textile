h1. Eclipse Configuration Files for Sirius

This directory contains configuration files for Eclipse which should be installed by every Sirius team member to ensure a common coding style.

* @CheckstyleConfiguration.xml@: the configuration file for CheckStyle v5. Import it from __Preferences > CheckStyle__. *Required for everyone*.
* If you change the CleanupProfile.xml, JavaFormatter.xml or sirius.importorder, you must also change the corresponding field in Sirius.setup file. Indeed, the content of these files is copied in Sirius.setup file because there is currently nothing to address these "preferences" in Oomph.
